## Features

- **State-of-the-Art Detection**: Built with YOLOv11 for real-time and high-accuracy tumor detection.
- **Custom Dataset**: Trained on a well-annotated medical image dataset.
- **Versatile Input**: Supports various image formats (DICOM, PNG, JPEG).
- **Detailed Output**: Annotated results with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
