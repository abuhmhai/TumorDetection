# Tumor Detection with YOLOv11

This repository implements a tumor detection system using **YOLOv11**, an advanced object detection model. The system aims to detect and classify tumors in medical images, providing faster and more accurate diagnostic support.

---

## Features

- **State-of-the-Art Detection**: Built with YOLOv11 for real-time and high-accuracy tumor detection.
- **Custom Dataset**: Trained on a well-annotated medical image dataset.
- **Versatile Input**: Supports various image formats (DICOM, PNG, JPEG).
- **Detailed Output**: Annotated results with bounding boxes and confidence scores.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-enabled GPU (for optimal training and inference performance)
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tumor-detection-yolov11.git
   cd tumor-detection-yolov11

	2.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Download pretrained YOLOv11 weights and save them in the weights/ directory:
	•	Pretrained YOLOv11 Weights

Usage

Training

To train the model on your dataset:

python train.py --data config/tumor.yaml --weights weights/yolov11-pretrained.pt --epochs 50

Inference

To perform inference on a test image:

python detect.py --weights weights/yolov11-trained.pt --source data/test/image.jpg

Evaluation

To evaluate the model on the validation set:

python val.py --data config/tumor.yaml --weights weights/yolov11-trained.pt

Dataset

	•	Structure:

data/
├── images/
│   ├── train/
│   ├── val/
│   └── test/
└── labels/
    ├── train/
    ├── val/
    └── test/


	•	Labels are in YOLO format, containing bounding box coordinates and class information.

Model Architecture

YOLOv11 offers the following enhancements:
	•	Dynamic Head Architecture: Improves feature extraction for smaller objects.
	•	Optimized NMS: More accurate suppression of overlapping boxes.
	•	Deeper Backbone: Better performance with high-resolution images.

Roadmap

	•	Add 3D tumor detection for MRI/CT scans.
	•	Integrate with web-based applications for real-time diagnosis.
	•	Explore advanced data augmentation techniques for improved accuracy.
	•	Expand support for multi-modal datasets (e.g., combining MRI, CT, and X-ray).
